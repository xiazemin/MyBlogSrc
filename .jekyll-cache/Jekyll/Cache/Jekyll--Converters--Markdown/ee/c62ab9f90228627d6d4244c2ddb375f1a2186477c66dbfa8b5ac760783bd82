I"•<p>Apply it to an old project
You have an existing project, and want to start using go modules? Run the following command, and youâ€™re almost done:</p>

<p>go mod init github.com/name/repo
The last argument, is the importable path to the directory youâ€™re working from.</p>

<p>If you are already using godep, you wonâ€™t need to do anything. The versions you specified prior, are copied over from your Godep files. All thatâ€™s left to do, is to delete the old Godeps.* files once the command is done.</p>

<p>When youâ€™re starting from scratch
If you havenâ€™t been using Godep on an old project, or are starting a new Go project and would like to use modules, all you need is a single command.</p>

<p>After the mod init command like above, you can use go get to add dependencies to the project, and have the module remember their exact version.</p>
