I"É<p>Sometimes you have to solve a problem that comes in several flavours. Usually complicated problems do not offer a single solution, but there are several solutions that are optimal or terrible depending on which subset of that problem the program will have to solve at runtime.</p>

<p>One example I faced was to analyse some data flowing in some connections that I was proxying.</p>

<p>There are two main ways to extract some information from traffic: you can either record the entire traffic to analyse it as soon as it is done, or you can analyse it while it flows(with a buffer window) at the cost of slowing it down.</p>

<p>Memory is relatively cheap compared to processing power, so my first solution to the problem was the buffered one.
