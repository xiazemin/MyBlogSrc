<p>Red/Blue Differential Flame Graphs
I’ve had many discussions about this for years, and finally wrote an implementation that I hope makes sense. It works like this:</p>

<p>Take stack profile 1.
Take stack profile 2.
Generate a flame graph using 2. (This sets the width of all frames using profile 2.)
Colorize the flame graph using the “2 - 1” delta. If a frame appeared more times in 2, it is red, less times, it is blue. The saturation is relative to the delta.
The intent is for use with before &amp; after profiles, such as for non-regression testing or benchmarking code changes. The flame graph is drawn using the “after” profile (such that the frame widths show the current CPU consumption), and then colorized by the delta to show how we got there.</p>

<p>The colors show the difference that function directly contributed (eg, being on-CPU), not its children.</p>
