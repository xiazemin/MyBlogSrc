<p>Go gettable library for wrapping openvpn functionality in go way. There are two main options for openvpn integration:</p>

<p>As external process - go-openvpn provides external process controls (start/stop), handles management interface, can work both as client and a service. External openvpn exe IS NOT provided (tested with openvpn 2.4.x release)
As built-in library - openvpn wraps c++ crosscompiled libary for all major oses (darwin,linux,win,ios and android), but has a limitation - can only work as client only.</p>
