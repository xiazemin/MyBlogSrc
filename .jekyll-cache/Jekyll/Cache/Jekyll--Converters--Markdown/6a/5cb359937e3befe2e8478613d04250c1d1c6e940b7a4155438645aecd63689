The analysis of source code at the syntactic level can help you with your coding in a variety of ways. For that, the text is almost always converted to AST first to make it easier to handle in most languages.
As some of you may know, Go has a powerful package go/parser, with it, you can convert source code to AST relatively easily. However, I couldnâ€™t help but be curious about how it is working, and I realized my mind could only be satisfied by getting started to read the API implementation. In this article, I will walk you through how it is converted, by reading the implementation of its API.</p>
