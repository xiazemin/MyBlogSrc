I"u<p>Working Set Size (WSS) is how much memory an application needs to keep working. Your application may have 100 Gbytes of main memory allocated and page mapped, but it is only touching 50 Mbytes each second to do its job. That’s the working set size: the “hot” memory that is frequently used. It is useful to know for capacity planning and scalability analysis.</p>
