tâ€™s not a secret that the world of software development is going through some massive changes: the increasing speed of releases, the advent of microservices and distributed infrastructures, and more. Rather than relying on a single technology to do everything, developers are able to select the best tools for each task. And one of the technologies that is enabling that change is Go. At Sqreen, we see these changes first hand. Since we started Sqreen in 2015, one of the most requested enhancements has consistently been support for the Go language.</p>
