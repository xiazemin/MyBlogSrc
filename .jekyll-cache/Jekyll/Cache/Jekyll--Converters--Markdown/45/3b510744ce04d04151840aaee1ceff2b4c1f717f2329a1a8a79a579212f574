Ensmallening Go binaries by prohibiting comparisons
Conventional wisdom dictates that the larger the number of types declared in a Go program, the larger the resulting binary. Intuitively this makes sense, after all, whatâ€™s the point in defining a bunch of types if youâ€™re not going to write code that operates on them. However, part of the job of a linker is to detect functions which are not referenced by a programâ€“say they are part of a library of which only a subset of functionality is usedâ€“and remove them from the final output. Yet, the adage moâ€™ types, moâ€™ binary holds true for the majority of Go programs.</p>
