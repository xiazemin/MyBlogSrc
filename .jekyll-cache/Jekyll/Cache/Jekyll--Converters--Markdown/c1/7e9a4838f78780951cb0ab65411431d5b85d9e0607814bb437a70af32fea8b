peer-to-peer communications and video-conferencing in HTML covered by this specification:</p>

<p>Connecting to remote peers using NAT-traversal technologies such as ICE, STUN, and TURN.
Sending the locally-produced tracks to remote peers and receiving tracks from remote peers.
Sending arbitrary data directly to remote peers.</p>

<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>

<p>An RTCPeerConnection instance allows an application to establish peer-to-peer communications with another RTCPeerConnection instance in another browser, or to another endpoint implementing the required protocols. Communications are coordinated by the exchange of control messages (called a signaling protocol) over a signaling channel which is provided by unspecified means, but generally by a script in the page via the server, e.g. using Web Sockets or XMLHttpRequest [xhr].</p>

<p>The RTCConfiguration defines a set of parameters to configure how the peer-to-peer communication established via RTCPeerConnection is established or re-established.</p>
