Building a BitTorrent client from the ground up in Go
Jan 4, 2020
tl;dr: What is the complete path between visiting thepiratebay and sublimating an mp3 file from thin air? In this post, weâ€™ll implement enough of the BitTorrent protocol to download Debian. Look at the Source code or skip to the last bit.
BitTorrent is a protocol for downloading and distributing files across the Internet. In contrast with the traditional client/server relationship, in which downloaders connect to a central server (for example: watching a movie on Netflix, or loading the web page youâ€™re reading now), participants in the BitTorrent network, called peers, download pieces of files from each otherâ€”this is what makes it a peer-to-peer protocol. Weâ€™ll investigate how this works, and build our own client that can find peers and exchange data between them.</p>
