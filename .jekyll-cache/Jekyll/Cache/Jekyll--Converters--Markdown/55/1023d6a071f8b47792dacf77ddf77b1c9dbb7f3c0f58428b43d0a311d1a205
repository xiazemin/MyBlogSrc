Introduction
When deploying applications into a production environment, building binaries with version information and other metadata will improve your monitoring, logging, and debugging processes by adding identifying information to help track your builds over time. This version information can often include highly dynamic data, such as build time, the machine or user building the binary, the Version Control System (VCS) commit ID it was built against, and more. Because these values are constantly changing, coding this data directly into the source code and modifying it before every new build is tedious and prone to error: Source files can move around and variables/constants may switch files throughout development, breaking the build process.</p>
