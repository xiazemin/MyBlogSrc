fgprof
fgprof is implemented as a background goroutine that wakes up 99 times per second and calls runtime.GoroutineProfile. This returns a list of all goroutines regardless of their current On/Off CPU scheduling status and their call stacks.</p>

<p>This data is used to maintain an in-memory stack counter which can be converted to the pprof or folded output format. The meat of the implementation is super simple and &lt; 100 lines of code, you should check it out.</p>

<p>The overhead of fgprof increases with the number of active goroutines (including those waiting on I/O, Channels, Locks, etc.) executed by your program. If your program typically has less than 1000 active goroutines, you shouldnâ€™t have much to worry about. However, at 10k or more goroutines fgprof is likely to become unable to maintain its sampling rate and to significantly degrade the performance of your application, see BenchmarkProfilerGoroutines.txt. The latter is due to runtime.GoroutineProfile() calling stopTheWorld(). For now the advise is to test the impact of the profiler on a development environment before running it against production instances. There are ideas for making fgprof more scalable and safe for programs with a high number of goroutines, but they will likely need improved APIs from the Go core.</p>

<p>Goâ€™s builtin CPU Profiler
The builtin Go CPU profiler uses the setitimer(2) system call to ask the operating system to be sent a SIGPROF signal 100 times a second. Each signal stops the Go process and gets delivered to a random threadâ€™s sigtrampgo() function. This function then proceeds to call sigprof() or sigprofNonGo() to record the threadâ€™s current stack.</p>

<p>Since Go uses non-blocking I/O, Goroutines that wait on I/O are parked and not running on any threads. Therefore they end up being largely invisible to Goâ€™s builtin CPU profiler.</p>
