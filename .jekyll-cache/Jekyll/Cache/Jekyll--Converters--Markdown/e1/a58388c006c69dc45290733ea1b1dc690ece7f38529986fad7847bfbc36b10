A collection of parallel image processing algorithms in pure Go.</p>

<p>The aim of this project is simplicity in use and development over absolute high performance, but most algorithms are designed to be efficient and make use of parallelism when available.</p>

<p>It uses packages from the standard library whenever possible to reduce dependency use and development abstractions.</p>

<p>All operations return image types from the standard library.</p>
