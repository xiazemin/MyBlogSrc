DataFrame: This ML API uses DataFrame from Spark SQL as an ML dataset, which can hold a variety of data types. E.g., a DataFrame could have different columns storing text, feature vectors, true labels, and predictions.
</div>
<div class="row">
Transformer: A Transformer is an algorithm which can transform one DataFrame into another DataFrame. E.g., an ML model is a Transformer which transforms a DataFrame with features into a DataFrame with predictions.
</div>
<div class="row">
Estimator: An Estimator is an algorithm which can be fit on a DataFrame to produce a Transformer. E.g., a learning algorithm is an Estimator which trains on a DataFrame and produces a model.Technically, an Estimator implements a method fit(), which accepts a DataFrame and produces a Model, which is a Transformer. 
</div>
<div class="row">
Pipeline: A Pipeline chains multiple Transformers and Estimators together to specify an ML workflow.
</div>
<div class="row">
Parameter: All Transformers and Estimators now share a common API for specifying parameters.

 For Transformer stages, the transform() method is called on the DataFrame. For Estimator stages, the fit() method is called to produce a Transformer (which becomes part of the PipelineModel, or fitted Pipeline), and that Transformerâ€™s transform() method is called on the DataFrame.
