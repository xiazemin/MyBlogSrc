<p>Be advised that, with Go 1.8 (currently in beta in Q4 2016, released in Q1 2017)</p>

<p>The yacc tool (previously available by running “go tool yacc”) has been removed.
As of Go 1.7 it was no longer used by the Go compiler.</p>

<p>It has moved to the “tools” repository and is now available at golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goyacc.
