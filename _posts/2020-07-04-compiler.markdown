Be advised that, with Go 1.8 (currently in beta in Q4 2016, released in Q1 2017)

The yacc tool (previously available by running “go tool yacc”) has been removed.
As of Go 1.7 it was no longer used by the Go compiler.

It has moved to the “tools” repository and is now available at golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goyacc.
