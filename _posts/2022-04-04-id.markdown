You should sort by the _uid field not by the _id field. The _id field is not accessible for sorting (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-id-field.html).

{
  "stored_fields": [
    "_id"
  ],
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  },
  "sort": {
    "_uid": "desc"
  },
  "size": 1
}
