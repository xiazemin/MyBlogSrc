A collection of parallel image processing algorithms in pure Go.

The aim of this project is simplicity in use and development over absolute high performance, but most algorithms are designed to be efficient and make use of parallelism when available.

It uses packages from the standard library whenever possible to reduce dependency use and development abstractions.

All operations return image types from the standard library.


使用纯 Go 实现图像处理，而且尽可能使用标准库实现。
