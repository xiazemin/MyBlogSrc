preg_match(): Allocation of JIT memory failed, PCRE JIT will be disabled.

There's no bug in PHP (there have been other PHP PCRE JIT bugs) but @c00000fd's issue is not a bug. PHP tries to get executable memory for the PCRE JIT and is blocked by Dreamhost's configuration (I think because /tmp is mounted noexec, Dreamhost doesn't appear to use SELinux, in any case the reason isn't important). PHP then displays this message, falls back to non-JIT PCRE, and continues processing with the JIT disabled. That's why this message only appears sometimes and pages otherwise appear normal. The fix is to put pcre.jit=0 into php.ini, see my comment on that answer below
