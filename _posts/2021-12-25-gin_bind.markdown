type Foo struct {
	Bar bool `json:"bar" binding:"required"` // True / False
}
When I send a JSON request with the value true it works, but when I send the same request with false I get the following error.

{
	"error": {
		"Foo.Bar": {
			"FieldNamespace": "Foo.Bar",
          		"NameNamespace": "Bar",
			"Field": "Bar",
			"Name": "Bar",
			"Tag": "required",
			"ActualTag": "required",
			"Kind": 1,
			"Type": {},
			"Param": "",
			"Value": false
		}
	}
},

Just an update to whomever is still stuck with this bug. Addind *bool is not the entire solution. You must change the binding:"required" to binding:"exists".


to further this answer exists was removed in v9 and required works with *bool

I highly recommend updating to v9, there were many performance updates and changes for ease of use :)
