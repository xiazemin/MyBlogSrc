When Uber started leveraging Go to develop our back-end services, we used the popular open source build system Make in combination with Go’s default build system go build.  

Upon moving our Android and iOS projects at Uber to a more efficient monorepo model, the Go Developer Experience team made a similar move for Go projects and found that Make and go build no longer met our needs. We finally decided to use Bazel, which provides good support for the Go language and is strengthened by constant contributions from its active open source community.

With a significant portion of our tech stack developed in Go, Uber’s Go monorepo is likely one of the largest Go repositories run on Bazel. We noticed areas where we could improve and contribute to the Bazel ecosystem, enhancing the generation of Bazel rules and integrating Bazel with SubmitQueue, Uber’s system for making sure the master branch of the monorepo can always build and test successfully. 

We hope our experience building a large repository with Bazel and our contributions to the open source Bazel ecosystem will help other engineering teams use Bazel to build their source code repositories.
